	<p class="centered">The Thing Doers, like many groups of people studying through Open Universities Australia, are a geographically diverse team with many different backgrounds. Our team members are:</p>

  <div class="overlay">
    <div><h5>Brendan Boyd (s3806780)</h5><br>Brendan has been working in the medical field since graduating with his first degree, and realised there are other ways he can help people, working in a field that is more progressive and that he has found interesting since he was young. Brendan grew up on property, and is not the ‘typical IT nerd’ type - gaming isn’t really his thing. In his spare time, he loves camping, exploring national parks and visiting new places. Brendan grew up with limited access to basic broadband, mobile phone services and even TV – pretty much any terrestrial distance-affected technology – which was a driver for his interest in IT and especially telecommunications. His IT experience and knowledge to date is self-taught but varied, and focussed on interest areas such as radio frequency and fixed line communications, and general computing.</div>

  <img src="Generic.png" alt="Callum" class="profpic">
  <div class="overlay">
    <div><h5>Callum Hunter (s3804323)</h5><br>Callum’s interest in IT came when his grandparents bought him a laptop for christmas in 2011, and he started playing games. This continued until the laptop got really slow, around 2013-14, and he decided to install linux, reasoning being "it can't get any worse". Troubleshooting Ubuntu and keeping everything working was what really sparked his interest, especially because Windows was too demanding for the laptop to run without overheating. Callum chose to study at RMIT because it was the first place he saw on Open Universities Australia. During his studies, Callum expects to learn better handling of computer systems, version control aids like Git, a greater variety of programming languages, and how to administrate infrastructure systems in a variety of environments, like Linux/Unix, Windows Server and BSD. Callum also hopes to enhance his social and planning skills.</div>

<div class="profpic-1">
  <img src="Generic.png" alt="Michael" class="profpic">
  <div class="overlay">
    <div><h5>Michael Plenert (s3807909)</h5><br>Michael Plenert is a Canadian who’s been living in Australia for the last three years. Over the last eighteen years, Michael has been a computer tech (starting on NT4.0 and Windows 98SE) and at times also worked as a web designer/developer. Michael is currently interested in Java (because of RMIT) and MariaDB. His hobbies include photography, drawing, working on and with computers, and playing video games.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="profpic-1">
  <img src="Generic.png" alt="Jess" class="profpic">
  <div class="overlay">
    <div><h5>***REMOVED*** (s3671077)</h5><br>Jess is a student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. Photography, gaming and racing are her three main hobbies. Her interest in technology peaked when she first started playing around with electronics and electrical equipment at home at a young age, and as time went on, she became introduced to gaming. This catapulted her into the tech scene. Jess has some experience with technology, and through building her first computer she has a solid understanding of computing hardware as well as some web and Java development.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="profpic-1">
  <img src="Generic.png" alt="Joe" class="profpic">
  <div class="overlay">
    <div><h5>Joseph Moore (s3800954)</h5><br>Joe currently works full-time in the utilities sector and is studying a Bachelor of Information Technology part-time through RMIT. In his spare time, he enjoys mountain bike riding, listening to podcasts, or reading a book. Joe started his career through completing a twelve-month business traineeship with a company in the utilities sector. He has remained with the company for the past five years since the beginning of his traineeship. Over the years in various roles, Joe has been exposed to aspects of the IT industry, which ultimately led to his interest in IT. This included acting as a bridge between IT and Operational teams, and using VBA to automate mundane tasks. From this initial interest, he began taking online courses through Udemy and Coursera, which covered a range of languages (SQL, VBA, Python and HTML/CSS). Joe currently has his eyes set on a Data Analyst role or similar after his studies with RMIT.</div>

<h2 class="centered">Personality Profiles</h2>
<p>*Brendan will add a HTML table here with the test results*</p>
<p>Each member of this group has their own unique personality profile, which combined form an ideal group cohort. A functional group needs a reliable and altruistic leader, a strategist and an abstract thinker, an energetic pace setter, and mediators to keep the peace. Michael is the group’s logician, an analyst and abstract thinker who is open minded and outgoing. Michael’s analysis of each group member’s project, based on opportunity for prototyping, aided in the selection of a group project. Won [BB1] is an energetic and strategic thinker with an eye for efficiency. Joe and Brendan are depicted as supporting group cohesion and keeping all members on track towards the end goal. Although somewhat introverted, Joe is an open-minded and flexible mediator, a trait which is essential to maintaining democracy within a functional group, whilst Brendan’s agreeable and supportive nature aids in the upkeep of group cohesion. He is observant of detail, and always looking to make improvements and share ideas that can contribute to the team’s overall success. Callum is the optimistic, imaginative and energetic member whose purpose is to keep up momentum within the group and help to maintain level-headedness during stressful periods. His creativeness was demonstrated early in the group’s formation by creating a work instruction on how to use Discord for group members with little experience. Finally, Jess is depicted as the group’s tolerant and reliable leader, whose above average verbal and group communication skills are paramount to this position. She has demonstrated qualities of a natural leader from the early stages of the group’s formation, taking charge in the setup of group expectations, planning group meetings and sharing learnings from previous group work.</p>

<p>As outlined in the table above, the Myers Briggs tests depict introversion as characteristic of most of the group, whilst Won and Jess provide enough extroversion to allow for a range of opinions. The potential for communication issues between the group’s introverts has been considered and planned for accordingly, using a team group chat and other tools as described in the report that can be found here.</p>

<p>The six group members share three common learning styles, which will be beneficial in the production and editing of this and other group assignments. Two group members learn by ‘doing’ and being directly involved in the activity at hand, two understand best with verbal explanations, and two prefer visual and written representations. Although geographical separation makes this difficult, it would be ideal to have at least one of each learning type present for the IT professional interview, as this task has practical, auditory and written components. Regardless, this and the next assignment have practical components such as website and project prototype creation that will suit the tactically inclined, written components that will benefit the read/write learners, and spoken components that will suit the auditory learners within the group.</p>

<h2 class="centered">Ideal Jobs</h2>
<p>**Brendan will add links where relevant**</p>
<p>Please see this table for a summary of the skillset and experience requirements for each group member’s ideal position.</p>

<p>Just as each member of the group has a unique personality profile, each member also has a unique ideal job in the IT field. Ideal jobs amongst the group members cover the life cycle of an IT project, from design and production, to data analysis and sales, through to support and maintenance. This variety outlines how broadly IT has integrated itself into many different types of positions.</p>
 
<p>Whilst each group member’s ideal job varies from the next, they can be grouped into three fundamental areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>high level design and management</li>
<li>analytical insights and data management</li>
<li>support-oriented and stakeholder management</li>
</ul>
<p>Top-level similarities can be identified between positions in these fundamental areas, and a shared group of core skills can be established between all positions and across all areas. At the top level, Jess and Michael’s positions as Solutions Architect and DevOps Lead at Amazon Web Services both entail the design, building and management of technological solutions for use by clients and stakeholders, both small and large. Both positions require design and conceptualisation skills with a strong technical focus, and the ability to cooperate with and manage teams of people to work towards goals and timelines. Leadership skills are a facet of team management and as such are also a requirement of both positions. Michael’s ‘dream job’ shares similarities with Joe’s Data Analyst position; Michael’s position involves building systems to collect, monitor and analyse data, whilst Joe’s involves deeper analysis of data to identify insights that could drive ICT improvements. One could assume that these positions would work synergistically together, one identifying data and the other providing further analysis. On a different side of the IT field, Brendan and Callum both aspire for support-oriented roles, one providing operational support and monitoring in a back-end environment for multiple stakeholders, and the other providing similar support in a more direct to the client, hands-on scenario. Both positions require the ability to effectively communicate with other IT professionals and stakeholders, and work both autonomously and collaboratively as required by the task. These positions also require the ability to liaise with third parties and end clients, synthesising and translating information and tailoring this to the requirements of the receiving individual. Won’s ideal position also shares this skillset; as a sales specialist, one is required to communicate with clients at their level of understanding to make the sale. For this position especially, these skills need to be perfected to ensure the client that the salesperson is knowledgeable and trustworthy.</p>
 
<p>As has been described, communication, cooperation and collaboration are core skills shared between each position across the three areas identified. Regardless of the position title, the delivery, management and upkeep of any IT project requires collaboration with multiple stakeholders and effective communication with end users. Each position also requires continued learning and upskilling to ensure end clients are provided with the most relevant products considering rapid changes in the technological landscape, and to ensure support is always available for these products. These common skills are integrated into IT positions from design and production, to analysis, to sales, then afterwards to maintenance and support.</p>
